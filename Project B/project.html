    <h1>Project Description</h1>

    <div class="project-container"> 
    <p> Welcome to "Audio Art," an interactive canvas that creates stunning visualizations based on electrical charges and sound waves. This project is designed to be both entertaining and educational, providing an opportunity to learn about physics and music in a unique and engaging way.

        The canvas is filled with a dynamic array of electric charges that interact with each other through lines that represent the electrical field. As the simulation progresses, the lines become more complex and vibrant, creating beautiful patterns that respond to the user's input.
        
        In addition to the visual experience, "Audio Art" also generates sound based on the user's actions. By adjusting the frequency and amplitude inputs, users can create an array of sounds that complement the visual display. The sound is generated through an oscillator and is modulated by the user's mouse movements, creating a truly interactive experience.
        
        The concept of audio art is grounded in the notion that sound and visuals are interconnected, and that the visual experience can be enriched by the addition of audio. By enabling users to create and design their own soundscapes, my project provides a platform for artistic expression that is not only visually stunning but also deeply personal.<p>
