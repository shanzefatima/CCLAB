  <h1>Project A - Dream Machine </h1>

  <!-- the following div will contain the p5 canvas. -->
  <div id="canvasContainer">Project Description</div>
  <p>Dream Machine is a generative project that continuously generates a dynamic visual presentation. The project showcases vibrant gradient circles, pulsating eye-shaped circles, and rotating triangles, which all dynamically move against a backdrop of undulating lines. You can engage with this project by clicking to include additional eye-shaped circles in the exhibit, further augmenting its aesthetic appeal.

    Now I would like you to test the project and enjoy its visuals ðŸ™‚ </p>
